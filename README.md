We can create "enumeated lists" (numbered lists)! Three things we'll look at:
1. How to use gif
2. How to use markdown for READMEs and the wiki
3. How to use HTML/CSS in Jekyll for pages

We can make bulleted lists! A few languages that we can discuss:
- C/C++
- Fortran
- **Python**
- Julia

Tables are also "easy"
|Column 1| Column 2|
|---------|-----------|
|Row 1     |Value 1|
|Row 2    | Value 2|
| Row 3    | Value 3|
| Row 4    | Value 4|
